## Running

**Usage**

```
$ python main.py --help
usage: main.py [-h] --symbol SYMBOL --size SIZE --type TYPE
               [--interval INTERVAL]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --symbol SYMBOL      Market Symbol (Ex: NEO/BTC - NEO/USDT)
  --size SIZE          What percentage the stop loss should be
                       placed above or below current price (e.g., 0.05 for 5%, 0.10 for 10%)
  --type TYPE          Specify whether the trailing stop loss should be in
                       buying or selling mode. (Ex: 'buy' or 'sell')
  --interval INTERVAL  How often the bot should check for price changes (default 5 seconds)
```



**Important note**

If you are running in sell mode, it is assumed that you have already purchased the coins. If you are running in buy mode, it will use the total available balance in the base (USDT, BTC, etc). I will likely add an option later to specify investment ratio.



## About the bot

**Buy mode**

If the **buy** option is set, the bot will initially place a stop-loss `size` satoshis (or USD) **above** the current market price. As the price goes lower, the stop-loss will get dragged with it, staying no higher than the size specified. Once the price crosses the stop-loss price, a buy order is executed.

**Sell mode**

If the **sell** option is set, the bot will initially place a stop-loss `size` satoshis (or USD) **below** the current market price. As the price goes higher, the stop-loss will get dragged with it, staying no lower than the size specified. Once the price crosses the stop-loss price, a sell order is executed.

**Size**

This is the amount in satoshis (or USD) you would like the stop-loss to be retained at. The difference between the current price and stop-loss will never be larger than this amount.
